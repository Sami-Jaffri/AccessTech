# ðŸ’» What Is It? 
AccessTech is a website created for COSC 101 (Digital Citizenship) at the University of British Columbia. It was constructed in hopes of acting as a hub
  to educational online resources in order to help bridge the digital divide. Furthermore, it marks the beginning of my journey into web development and 
  showcases the skills, and knowledge I have picked up along the way.
